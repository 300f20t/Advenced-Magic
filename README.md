## Advenced Magic
Advanced Magic is a magic mod for minecraft that allows you to create modifiable magic items from various materials and conduct magic research. A magic table is required for research and adding modifiers. There are 2 main types of magic items in fashion: magic rings and magic wands. The following types of modifiers can be used on all subjects: 1. Type modifiers. 2. Mana modifiers. 3. Speed modifiers. 4. Power modifiers. The modifiers of the type are faceted stones created with the help of new tools - files. The mana and speed modifiers are amethysts and Echo fragments, respectively. Power modifiers are "heavy" items such as obsidian, weeping obsidian, nezerite ingot and Nezer star, which give 1 to 5 power, which in some cases is the number of repetitions of the spell, and in some does not affect at all. This is only a small part of the features provided by the mod, as it contains many unique mechanics.
